	Abstract = {ABSTRACT N-linked glycan distribution affects important end-use characteristics such as the bioactivity and efficacy of many therapeutic proteins, (including monoclonal antibodies), in vivo. Yet, obtaining desired glycan distributions consistently during batch-to-batch production can be challenging for biopharmaceutical manufacturers. While an appropriately implemented on-line glycosylation control strategy during production can help to ensure a consistent glycan distribution, to date no such strategies have been reported. Our goal is to develop and validate a comprehensive strategy for effective on-line control of glycosylation, the successful achievement of which requires first identifying appropriate manipulated variables that can be used to direct the glycan distribution to a desired state. While various culture conditions such as bioreactor process variables, media type, and media supplements have been shown to affect the glycan distribution, in this study we focus on the latter. Specifically, we implemented a statistically designed series of experiments to determine the significant main effects (as well as interaction effects) of media supplementation with manganese, galactose, ammonia and found that each had significant effects on certain glycans. We also include data indicating the glycosylation enzyme gene transcript levels as well as the intracellular nucleotide sugar concentrations in the presence of the media supplements to provide insight into the intracellular conditions that may be contributing to the changes in glycan distribution. The acquired experimental data sets were then used to identify which glycans can be controlled by the media supplements and to what degree. We determined that MnCl2 can be used as a manipulated variable to increase the relative abundance of M51 and decrease FA2 simultaneously, and galactose can be used as a manipulated variable to increase the relative abundance of FA2G1 and decrease FA2 and A2 simultaneously.

	Abstract = {Abstract Monoclonal antibodies are critically important biologics as the largest class of molecules used to treat cancers, rheumatoid arthritis, and other chronic diseases. Antibody glycosylation is a critical quality attribute that has ramifications for patient safety and physiological efficacy---one that can be modified by such factors as media formulation and process conditions during production. Using a design-of-experiments approach, we examined the effect of 2-F-peracetyl fucose (2FP), uridine, and galactose on cell growth and metabolism, titer, and gene expression of key glycosylation-related proteins, and report how the glycoform distribution changed from Days 4 to 7 in a batch process used for IgG1 production from Chinese hamster ovary cells. We observed major glycosylation changes upon supplement addition, where the addition of 2FP decreased antibody fucosylation by up to 48\%, galactose addition increased galactosylation by up to 21\%, and uridine addition decreased fucosylation and increased galactosylation by 6\% and 2\%, respectively. Despite having major effects on glycosylation, neither galactose nor 2FP significantly affected cell culture growth, metabolism, or titer. Uridine improved peak cell densities by 23\% but also reduced titer by ∼30\%. The supplements caused significant changes in gene expression by Day 4 of the cultures where 2FP addition significantly reduced fucosyltransferase 8 and nucleotide sugar transporter gene expression (by ∼2-fold), and uridine addition significantly increased expression of UDP-GlcNAcT (SLC35A3) and B4GALT1--6 genes (by 1.5--3-fold). These gene expression data alongside glycosylation, metabolic, and growth data improve our understanding of the cellular mechanisms affected by media supplementation and suggest approaches for modifying antibody glycosylation in antibody production processes.},

	Abstract = {In an attempt to improve process safety, today's plants deploy sophisticated automation and control strategies. Despite these, accidents continue to occur. Statistics indicate that human error is the predominant contributor to accidents today. Traditionally, human error is only considered during process hazard analysis. However, this discounts the role of operators in abnormal situation management. Recently, with the goal to develop proactive strategies to prevent human error, we utilized eye tracking to understand the situation awareness of control room operators. Our previous studies reveal the existence of specific eye gaze patterns that reveal operators' cognitive processes. This paper further develops this cognitive engineering based approach and proposes novel quantitative measures of operators' situation awareness. The proposed measures are based on eye gaze dynamics and have been evaluated using experimental studies. Results demonstrate that the proposed measures reliably identify the situation awareness of the participants during various phases of abnormal situation management.},

	Abstract = {Alarm systems in chemical plants alert process operators to deviations in process variables beyond predetermined limits. Despite more than 30 years of research in developing various methods and tools for better alarm management, the human aspect has received relatively less attention. The real benefit of such systems can only be identified through human factors experiments that evaluate how the operators interact with these decision support systems. In this paper, we report on a study that quantifies the benefits of a decision support scheme called Early Warning, which predicts the time of occurrence of critical alarms before they are actually triggered. Results indicate that Early Warning is helpful in reaching a diagnosis more quickly; however it does not improve the accuracy of correctly diagnosing the root cause. Implications of these findings for human factors in process control and monitoring are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Ensuring consistent glycosylation-associated quality of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) has become a priority in pharmaceutical bioprocessing given that the distribution and composition of the carbohydrates (glycans) bound to these molecules determines their therapeutic efficacy and immunogenicity. However, the interaction between bioprocess conditions, cellular metabolism and the intracellular process of glycosylation remains to be fully understood. To gain further insight into these interactions, we present a novel integrated modelling platform that links dynamic variations in mAb glycosylation with cellular secretory capacity. Two alternative mechanistic representations of how mAb specific productivity (qp) influences glycosylation are compared. In the first, mAb glycosylation is modulated by the linear velocity with which secretory cargo traverses the Golgi apparatus. In the second, glycosylation is influenced by variations in Golgi volume. Within our modelling framework, both mechanisms accurately reproduce experimentally-observed dynamic changes in mAb glycosylation. In addition, an optimisation-based strategy has been developed to estimate the concentration of glycosylation enzymes required to minimise mAb glycoform variability. Our results suggest that the availability of glycosylation machinery relative to cellular secretory capacity may play a crucial role in mAb glycosylation. In the future, the modelling framework presented here may aid in selecting and engineering cell lines that ensure consistent mAb glycosylatio.},

	Abstract = {Summary
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells dominate biotherapeutic protein production and are widely used in mammalian cell line engineering research. To elucidate metabolic bottlenecks in protein production and to guide cell engineering and bioprocess optimization, we reconstructed the metabolic pathways in CHO and associated them with >1,700 genes in the Cricetulus griseus genome. The genome-scale metabolic model based on this reconstruction, iCHO1766, and cell-line-specific models for CHO-K1, CHO-S, and CHO-DG44 cells provide the biochemical basis of growth and recombinant protein production. The models accurately predict growth phenotypes and known auxotrophies in CHO cells. With the models, we quantify the protein synthesis capacity of CHO cells and demonstrate that common bioprocess treatments, such as histone deacetylase inhibitors, inefficiently increase product yield. However, our simulations show that the metabolic resources in CHO are more than three times more efficiently utilized for growth or recombinant protein synthesis following targeted efforts to engineer the CHO secretory pathway. This model will further accelerate CHO cell engineering and help optimize bioprocesses.},

	Abstract = {{Over the past decade, machine learning techniques have made substantial advances in many domains. In health care, global interest in the potential of machine learning has increased; for example, a deep learning algorithm has shown high accuracy in detecting diabetic retinopathy. There have been suggestions that machine learning will drive changes in health care within a few years, specifically in medical disciplines that require more accurate prognostic models (eg, oncology) and those based on pattern recognition (eg, radiology and pathology).However, comparative studies on the effectiveness of machine learning{\^a}€``based decision support systems (ML-DSS) in medicine are lacking, especially regarding the effects on health outcomes. Moreover, the introduction of new technologies in health care has not always been straightforward or without unintended and adverse effects. In this Viewpoint we consider the potential unintended consequences that may result from the application of ML-DSS in clinical practice.}},

	Abstract = {Hazard and operability analysis (HAZOP) is widely used in process hazard analysis of chemical processes. But it is time and effort consuming. To aid human experts in conducting HAZOP analysis in a more thorough and systematic way, a software system (PHASuite) for automated HAZOP analysis has been developed. PHASuite can greatly increase the efficiency of the HAZOP analysis, support best analysis practices, and provide foundation for reuse of the safety knowledge generated from the analysis. Given the knowledge intensive nature of HAZOP analysis, a knowledge engineering framework was developed. From the point of view of functionality, the framework consists of four main parts: information sharing, representation, knowledge base and reasoning engine. Ontology based information sharing schemes are developed to share process information and results with other systems. Coloured Petri Nets based representation, created from process information, is used to represent chemical processes as well as the methodology for HAZOP analysis. In this framework, a process is decomposed into two abstraction levels, operation level and equipment level, which are bridged using functional representation. Analysis is carried out on both the levels. Knowledge used in this system is stored in models. Case-based techniques are adopted for knowledge management. Knowledge base is stored externally in structured databases. A two-level, two-layer reasoning engine has been designed to operate on the Petri Nets representation of the process using the knowledge base to perform HAZOP analysis.},

	Abstract = {Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a novel modeling approach to address the complexity of systems that comprise heterogeneous interacting individuals. ABM is naturally hybrid for its ability to integrate quantitative and qualitative knowledge, deals with multiple levels of actions, and performs best when combined with conventional modeling approaches. In this study, a hybrid agent-based platform is developed using high performance computing to simulate a mammalian cell culture bioreactor. This platform enables communication of the agent-based model with the first principle models to account for quantitative changes in nutrient and metabolite concentrations and their distribution in the bioreactor. The model can predict viable cell density, and the cell cycle distributions along with the important nutrients and metabolites such as glucose and lactate. Integrating this cell culture agent-based model with highperformance computing leverages parallel processing to allow the ABM program to run faster, more efficiently, and with a higher capacity for the number of cells that can be modeled. The model is validated using bench-scale bioreactor experiments and showed good agreement with experimental data.},

	Abstract = {Recent systemic failures in different domains have reminded us, once again, of the fragility of complex sociotechnical systems. Although the failures occurred in very different domains, there are, however, certain common underlying mechanisms driving these disasters. Understanding these mechanisms is essential to avoid such disasters in the future. To understand them, one needs to go beyond analyzing them as independent one-off accidents, and examine them in the broader perspective of the potential fragility of sociotechnical systems. It is their scale, nonlinearity, inter-connectedness, and interactions with humans and the environment that can make these systems fragile. Here we present an overview of the challenges and opportunities in the modeling and analysis of sociotechnical systems. We highlight a control-theoretic modeling framework that unifies the social and the technical components. We discuss how certain problems can be addressed by using concepts and techniques from causal modeling, game theory, and behavioral economics.},
